## Topics

<!-- If you would like to add a topic to the agenda please add your name to the appropriate list above and add a suggestion to the PR using the following format: -->

### SV lab schedule (RS, 10 minutes)

We need to pin down the schedule for the Sierra Vista lab. This includes working with AV to make sure keys are available.

### Lab Manual (RS, 15 minutes)

First draft is done(ish!) You can find it here: https://mavrxlab.github.io/lab-manual/

What is it missing? What needs blown out?

### MetaMeta (Newsletter) (RS, 5 minutes)

Need to work out a process/protocol for getting input. MetaMeta, as the newsletter is called (https://mavrxlab.org/newsletter) consists of 3 news items, 1 bit of lab news, and 1 article citation and abstract. See the first issue for an example: https://www.getrevue.co/profile/metameta/issues/metameta-issue-1-ma-vr-x-lab-uarizona-968973

### Protocols.io (RS, 10 minutes)

Introduction to Protocols.io. This is where the lab will be keeping any relevant step-by-step instructions that aren't sensitive or confidential in nature. (Good place to keep the MetaMeta process!)

Someone want to volunteer to become a protocols.io expert?

### Adobe Aero (RS, 2 minutes)

RS will be working with the public relations folks at CAST on a public works project. To support this, we need an Adobe Aero expert that can be the point-person for the project's augmented reality component. Volunteers?
